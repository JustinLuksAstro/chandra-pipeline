This project makes extensive use of tools, scripts, and workflows provided by the Chandra X-ray Center (CXC).

Most of the command-line procedures, scientific methods, and data processing utilities are based on resources from the official CIAO documentation and software suite:

We gratefully acknowledge the CIAO team and the broader Chandra X-ray Observatory community for making these tools publicly available and well-documented.
